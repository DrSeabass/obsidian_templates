# Problem Statement

A concise, 2–3 paragraph description of the core scientific/computational problem this project aims to address. Frame:

- What is the input/output behavior we want?
- What is missing in current approaches?
- What tension or gap motivates the research?

## Core Ideas & Conceptual Approach

A high-level description of the strategy or conceptual frame guiding the research. Usually 3–6 bullets such as:

- How transition classifiers provide information to search 
- How numeric guidance interacts with discrete classifier signals 
- Key assumptions or design principles
## Project Goals & Expected Impacts

A bulleted list of **stable, long-lived goals**. Include:
- What the project ultimately aims to achieve
- Outcomes, not tasks
- These goals should change slowly, if ever
- Goals should highlight who would care and what would change
  
# Major Research Axes & Projects

## Overview
Break the project into 2–4 major directions or lanes. These map to:
- Hypotheses you’ll test
- Experiment families
- Cross-linked notes

Examples:
- Ranking-based guidance
- Search-strategy blending
- Noise robustness & calibration
- Translation to non-planning domains
