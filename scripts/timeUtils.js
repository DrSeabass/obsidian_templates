/**
 * Time Tracking Utilities
 * 
 * NOTE: This file is for documentation purposes only.
 * The actual time tracking functionality has been embedded directly in the templates
 * to avoid issues where tp.user.timeUtils() might not be available in DataviewJS contexts.
 * 
 * The core functions that were previously intended for this file are now embedded in each template:
 * 
 * 1. parseTimeLog: Parses the time log table and calculates hours by tag
 * 2. aggregateTimeLogs: Combines time data from multiple notes
 * 3. generateChartCode: Creates chart code for visualization
 * 
 * See the README.md file in this directory for more information.
