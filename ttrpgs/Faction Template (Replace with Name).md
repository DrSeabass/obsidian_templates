A brief description of the faction here.  Who they are and what they want.

# Current Posture

| Active Goals | Resources Committed | Last Acted Scene | Under Pressure?    | Threads Spawned |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| 2            | 1 asset, 0 allies   | [[Scene 11]]     | Yes (goal stalled) | 1               |

# Strategic Imperatives
1. Imperatives should be numbered.  
2. All factions should have at least one, and probably no more than 3 unless there is a very, very good reason for it.  When everything is a priority, nothing is.
3. Imperatives should be wiki links (e.g. ```[[Imperative Name]]```).  That way we can see easily when factions are aligned or competing.

## 1. [[Required Imperative]]
## 2. [[Optional Imperative]]
## 3. [[Another Optional Imperative]]

# Assets
The means that a faction has to help it achieve its ends. It could be the loyalty of an individual or party, like a skilled band of assassins.  Maybe it's a physical location, like a secret hide out or fortified keep.  

It's important to note that assets must be at least a little good, but they needn't be purely good.  They may have leverage over a noble lord.  Leverage is powerful, but dangerous.



# Strategic Goals
## How-To
### Notes
* Aligned with the strategic imperatives.  These are the ways in which the faction achieves its imperatives and overall goals.
* When a goal is achieved, the world should change
	* Faction Gains an Asset
	* Opposing Faction Loses an Asset
	* A major story beat is added or closed
#### Template
A plain text description of the goal that the faction is trying to achieve.  
1. It should include a pointer to the faction's strategic imperative as a link, (```[[]]```).   
2. Progress is tracked in terms of steps.
	1. The number of steps should be set up front.
		1. 3 is trivial
		2. 5 is easy
		3. 10 is moderate
		4. 15 is hard / long term
	2. Sometimes you'll also know concrete steps, these can be laid out ahead
	3. Sometimes you wont, but progress towards a goal (or against) will become obvious when it happens

### Inactive
- Roll 1d6 after each scene 
- - **+1**: Favorable environment, support assets committed
- **+1**: Enemy faction is distracted or weakened
- **–1**: At disadvantage, under pressure or blocked
- **–1**: Opposition asset active

| Result (1d6+mods) | Progress        |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| ≤ 2               | 0 (no progress) |
| 3–4               | 1 segment       |
| 5–6               | 2 segments      |
| 7+                | 3 segments      |
### Active
| Fiction Outcome                            | Progress |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Faction achieves major milestone           | +5 to +6 |
| Faction completes key action in goal chain | +4       |
| Faction gains clear advantage              | +3       |
| Faction makes indirect but meaningful gain | +2       |
| Faction attempt stalled or rebuffed        | 0        |
| Faction suffers setback or opposition      | –2 to –4 |
| Faction loses asset or credibility         | –5+      |
### Examples

| Scene      | Roll (w/mod)     | Segments Gained | Notes                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| \[\[link]] | 5 (6–1)          | 5               | Resupplied via safehouse. Nearly complete.     |
| \[\[link]] | 2 (natural 1 +1) | 2               | Spotted by rival agents. Risk of interference. |

# Relationships

* Relationships are kind of like assets in waiting.  
	* A nation may think fondly of me, but I still need to petition them for aid in order to get their help. 
* Factions that are unaware of each other could default to neutral
	* Unless there's some good reason not to (e.g. a faction is inclined to war)
* Relationships between factions should be somewhat consistent
	* That probably means limited relationship score deltas
	* E.g. if you are at war with my friend with my ally, it does not make sense for me to be allied to you
	* 2 Steps seems like the maximum delta
* Moving up the ladder is harder than moving down the ladder
* Moving from a 1 to a 2 is easier than moving from a 2 to a 3
